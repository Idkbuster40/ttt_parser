# Tiny Texture Tumbler C parser.

## Does what it says on the tin.
### Works with: [Tiny Texture Tumbler - by PhobosLab](https://github.com/phoboslab/ttt)

---

### How it works:

> It takes an input, like `[[32,32,65535,2,52419,1]]` which is a white texture with noise applied on top. 32*32px. 

> It takes it, and uses some **magic** (which is really just the code converted from js to c) and spits out a texture.

> Then it uses (some) code (which does not exist at the moment of writing this.)

> This texture can be used wherever. I need to figure out how to implement this. 

###### W.I.P -- COME BACK LATER.
